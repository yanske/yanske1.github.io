  <h3>👋 Hi, I'm Yan!</h3>
  <p>
    I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science / Statistics student at the <a class="ext" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Waterloo</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I previously interned as a software engineer 💻 at <a class="ext" href="https://www.scribd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scribd</a>, <a class="ext" href="https://www.shopify.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a>, <a class="ext" href="https://www.aterica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aterica</a>, working on backend systems. Throughout my internships, I also learned how to process data at scale and make data-driven product decisions. Check out more of what I've done on my <a class="ext" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Yan_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my free time, I enjoy catching up on my favourite dramas 📺, playing badminton 🏸, listening to an audiobook 🎧, or enjoying a cup of coffee or tea ☕.
