With the [Alley](http://www.the-alley.ca/) in my neighborhood releasing the
[Deerioca](https://www.straight.com/food/1231926/photos-sneak-peek-inside-taiwanese-bubble-tea-chain-alley-downtown-vancouver),
a simple drink with brown sugar tapioca pearls and fresh milk,
a while back, it's been my favorite drink to get at any boba joints.
The sweet, chewy sensation of the warm boba is
the perfect companion for the light, refreshing taste of fresh milk. While to
me, this drink is perfection, I can't help but notice how much I'm being ripped
off. Any brown sugar latte or their cousin variants are simply made of three
ingredients: boba, milk, and a shit ton of sweetener. Being charged over $6 per
drink considering what goes in is ludicrous.

So I decided to try to replicate my favorite drink at home, and through a few
test runs, I've arrived at a somewhat-doable-with-practice-ish recipe in terms
of difficulty and time, but the outcome is a
definitely-very-delicious-drink-if-we-add-the-sugar. :)

### Ingredients

For the pearls themselves, we'll be using **tapioca starch**,
**brown sugar (packed)**, and **water** in a 3:1:1 volume ratio.

As for serving sizes, using 1 cup of starch will probably be enough for around
5 cups of boba.

### Steps

1. Boil the water in a pot, and dissolve the brown sugar in the water. Once
fully dissolved, mix in the tapioca starch slowly. This is part one of two of
the hardest part of the recipe.

2. Once the mixture is starting to take place, take it out of the pot
and begin kneading. The goal here is to make sure the starch is
evenly distributed and there are no chunks of undissolved starch. This is part
two of the hardest part, but it is important to be speedy, as once the mixture
cools down it'll be impossible to mold the mixture into balls.

3. Now, we can begin making our tapioca. Pull and roll the mixture into long
cylinders (like noodles!), and begin cutting them into little pearl shaped
chunks before rolling them into balls (optional). Since these little boys are
going to expand when we cook them, it's important to keep them at around half
the 3/4 of the size of regular tapioca if you still want them to go up a straw.
When collecting the individual pearls, make sure to coat them with a bit more
tapioca starch to avoid sticking.

4. Finally, we can begin cooking the tapioca. In boiling water, drop in the
pearls and cook for 25 minutes. At that point, turn off the heat and let rest
for another 10 minutes.

5. Drain the water and collect the pearls over a strainer. To make them more
saucy and sticky, put them back into a pan/pot and heat them with brown sugar
or honey.

### Tada!

With the tapioca ready, simply put them into a cup and serve with fresh milk!
While this process is lengthy, it's certainly worth the treat!
