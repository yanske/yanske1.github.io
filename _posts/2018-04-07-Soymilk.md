Recently I was watching [JunsKitchen](https://www.youtube.com/user/JunsKitchen "JunsKitchen") and I was inspired to try making soymilk from scratch. I really did turn out to be suprisingly simple!

### Preparation

Things you'll need:

* Soybeans
* Blender
* Filter

### Process

1. Wash and soak the beans for around a day.
