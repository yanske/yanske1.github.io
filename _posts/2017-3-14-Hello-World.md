After much procrastination, I've finally decided to start a blog! For those that don't know me, I'm currently an engineering student at the University of Waterloo with an unhealthy obsession with ice-cream, orange juice, and hot chocolate. 


In this blog, I'll *probably* post pictures of the food I experiment with, the places I go, or where ever my 2 a.m. brain wanders. 


Let's keep in touch!
