 For my 1A mechatronics concept course design project, my group and I decided to build an automatic ping-pong ball shooter. The Tron Table Tennis Trainer (TTTT) is build from 3-D printed gears, an acrylic base, LEGO pieces and Mindstorm sensors, programmed on the NXT using robotC (a C based programming language). 

The TTTT is able to load up to 15 balls, and shoot a maximum frequency of approximately 1.5s over a net, at an variety of angles.
