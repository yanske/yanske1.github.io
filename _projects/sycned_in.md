For Hack the North (my first hackathon!), my team decided to build an app to allow users to "tap into" booths using their smart devices, syncing information, exchanging contacts, etc. It was my first time experimenting with languages and tools used to build this project, but I had a lot of fun learning and apply what I learned.

There are three components to Synced In, an iOS app for the users, iBeacons to identify which booth the user's at, and a web app which allows booth owners to track information, set up sessions, and so on.
