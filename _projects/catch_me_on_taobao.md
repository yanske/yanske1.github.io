Catch Me on TaoBao is a Chrome extension that helps you find luxury good for less. When you go on a site like [https://kanyeweststores.com](https://kanyeweststores.com) or [https://www.kyliecosmetics.com](https://www.kyliecosmetics.com) (or any Shopify based e-commerce store), with Catch Me on TaoBao, the next time you try to "Add to Cart", we'll take you to a similar product on [TaoBao](https://world.taobao.com/) (A premier knock off site :^) ) instead.

Catch Me on TaoBao is built purely in Javascript. It is a Chrome extension that is able to detect if you are on a product site, and is able to make a back end call to our NodeJS API developed with StdLib to help find a corresponding TaoBao product.
