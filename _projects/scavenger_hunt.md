Over the summer, my friend and I made Scavenger Hunt, a web / mobile app to help host large scale scavenger hunt games.

On the web end, a 'creater' / 'observer' can initialize a new game, set up multiple objectives by clicking on a map, and track the leader boards.

The users would then use the mobile app to enter games, track their progress and the location of the objectives. When they find an objective, they can send it up to the infrastructure by taking a picture of it.
