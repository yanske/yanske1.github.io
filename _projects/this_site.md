While I was learning python in the summer of 2016, I decided to experiment with Flask to create my personal website. I eventually realized that having an admin interface and database isn't the most pratical for a personal website, and removed it, but continued to develop the site whenever I had spare time.

I've recently added a personal <a href = "{{site.url}}/blog/">blog</a> which is powered by Jekyll, check me out!
