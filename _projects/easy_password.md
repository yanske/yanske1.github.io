Recently, I have developed an interest in computer vision and crytopgraphy. To explore my interest, I am currently making a password management app which uses facial recognition to detect the user. 

This is an ongoing project, which currently stores user data using crytographic hashes and encrytions implemented using OpenSSL. It is able to detect a face, and I am currently working on progressing this functionality from detection to recognition.
