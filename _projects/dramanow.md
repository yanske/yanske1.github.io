DramaNow is a Chrome client and Rails API that helps you track where you are with your favourite shows and checks for new episodes for you. Gone with the messy bookmarks. DramaNow automatically syncs your current watching activities and puts you back where you left off in its interface.

Currently it only supports Dramafever, which is tragic since it recently [shut down](https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/dramafever-k-drama-shutting-down-warner-bros-1202982001/).

In the future, I plan to add support to allow users to define elements to scrape, so more sites can be easily supported and tracked.
