Winter is coming? More like spoilers are coming. And on the Internet, they're EVERYWHERE. Thats why my friends and I made a Chrome extension for Hack the 6ix to address this problem.

Spoilers Suck parses through text and images in your browsing page, sends the content to a backend that uses an algorithm to determine whether or not the content is related to a show you opted to remove spoilers for.
