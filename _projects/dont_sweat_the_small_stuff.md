For Hack4Health, a hackathon dedicated to increasing the quality of life for individuals living with MS or dementia, my teammate and I decided to make an app to help individuals living with MS organze their daily taskes, based on their energy level and the importances of each task.

After coming up with the idea, my teammate began working on the mock-up while I worked on the Android app. Being my first time working with Android, I initially ran into many bugs and deadends, but eventually in an afternoon, I was able to set up the main pages, prompting for an user's energy level, making a task list(stored on Firebase), and recommending whether a user should tackle a task based on their energy level.
